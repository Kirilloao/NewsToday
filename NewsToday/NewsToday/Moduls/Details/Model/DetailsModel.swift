Select a state for detailed results, and select the Senate, House or Governor tabs to view those races. For more detailed state results click on the States A-Z links at the bottom of this page. Traditionally, Iowa has held the first caucus of the election season and New Hampshire the first primary. While the Republican Party will continue to start their nominating contests in these states, the Democratic Party has sought to make South Carolina the first Democratic contest, arguing that the state is more representative of the party's demographics. As a result, the Democratic National Committee has scrapped the Iowa caucus (instead holding a primary in the state in March) and urged candidates not to put their name on the New Hampshire ballot.The staggered nature of the primary calendar allows candidates to focus their resources on groups of states at different times instead of all at once. Often candidates focus on winning some or all of the early states to gain momentum in the race as well as seeking to win large states that can earn them a high number of delegates. The largest delegate states are California, Texas and Florida. For more detailed state results click on the States A-Z links at the bottom of this page.
